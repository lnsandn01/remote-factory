# remote-factory
## Controling a factory via a 3D-clone in Web-XR

**!Warning!** This project needs some clean-up before it can be used.<br>
**!Warning!** This is just a prototype<br>

This is just for showcasing how you could remotely control a device connected to the internet, by interacting with a 3D-model of the device in VR.<br>
This even works with eg. the Oculus 2 hand-tracking functionality.<br>
The main issue with this is the labor intensive process, of creating a 3D-model, and a funcitonal model in Nodejs that represent the device or devices.<br>

This project was setup with the free prototyping webservice [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com), that has a nice WebXR integration and website builder.
